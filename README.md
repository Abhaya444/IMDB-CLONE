# IMDB-CLONE
This Project is about a mini IMDB clone app in which and named MOVIE-BOX. Here we can search movies based on OMDB API, with search suggestions. Clicking on a particular movie card opens a new movie page for more info. On clicking on the favourite button, we can add a movie to the favourite list which is using local storage to store movies.
